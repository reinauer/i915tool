as of may 31, we can light up the panel and attach a pipe.

this powers on the panel.

OK so in dpms we have only really enabled panel power and backlight. 

Next step is to try the actual loading, which should make the screen
at least flicker.


we're not doing link training correctly for some reason. Actually we're not
doing it at all.

Can't just call the gen6 link train. There is setup that has
to happen first. oh well. 

NOTE: This is called: drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes but it's 
really all about copying from filled-in structs to user mode. We don't need
it.

v[    0.733227] [drm:drm_enable_connectors], connector 5 enabled? yes
[    0.733233] [drm:drm_enable_connectors], connector 12 enabled? no
[    0.733239] [drm:drm_enable_connectors], connector 15 enabled? no
[    0.733253] [drm:drm_enable_connectors], connector 18 enabled? no
does not real hardware stuff. Again, polling for user


4. If enabling port on PCH: (Must be done before enabling CPU pipe or FDI)
a. Enable PCH FDI Receiver PLL, wait for warmup plus DMI latency
b. Switch from Rawclk to PCDclk in FDI Receiver (FDI A OR FDI B)
c. [DevSNB] Enable CPU FDI Transmitter PLL, wait for warmup
d. [DevILK] CPU FDI PLL is always on and does not need to be enabled
5. Enable CPU panel fitter if needed for hires, required for VGA (Can be done anytime before enabling CPU pipe)
6. Configure CPU pipe timings, M/N/TU, and other pipe settings (Can be done anytime before enabling CPU pipe)
7. Enable CPU pipe
8. Configure and enable CPU planes (VGA or hires)
9. If enabling port on PCH:
a. Program PCH FDI Receiver TU size same as Transmitter TU size for TU error checking
b. Train FDI
i. Set pre-emphasis and voltage (iterate if training steps fail)
ii. Enable CPU FDI Transmitter and PCH FDI Receiver with Training Pattern 1 enabled.

iii. Wait for FDI training pattern 1 time
iv. Read PCH FDI Receiver ISR ([DevIBX-B+] IIR) for bit lock in bit 8 (retry at least once if no lock)
v. Enable training pattern 2 on CPU FDI Transmitter and PCH FDI Receiver
vi. Wait for FDI training pattern 2 time
vii. Read PCH FDI Receiver ISR ([DevIBX-B+] IIR) for symbol lock in bit 9 (retry at least once if no lock)
viii. Enable normal pixel output on CPU FDI Transmitter and PCH FDI Receiver
ix. Wait for FDI idle pattern time for link to become active

OK, with 

And this call stack
drm_crtc_helper_set_mode 321
intel_get_load_detect_pipe 3946
cli.c: 115

we get the backlight.

So, time for some IO logging.


OK, we added the framebuffer and set i915_panel_ignore_lid 1 , i.e. always on.
