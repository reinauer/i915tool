spatches are the semantic patches
tmp is just tmp
inputs are copied from $LINUX
per-file-changes contain input files that have specific transforms
final contains the final form of the file, with 'global' changes applied (e.g. kzalloc -> calloc)

transform copies files from $LINUX and then transforms them for use by stand-alone program/coreboot

The Makefile is simple; this runs 'fast enough' that a complicated Makefile is not worth it. 

There's still some duct tape here but it's getting there. 

There are coccinelle bugs so be careful about assuming that something
that looks wrong is wrong. 

To build pretty regs, I ran
 awk -f buildregs.awk /usr/local/src/firmware/src/third_party/coreboot/src/mainboard/google/link/i915io.c > buildregs.c
Did a little hand editing, and ran
cc -g prettyregs.c
and ran that
